# Initiative-Tracker
A simple initiative tracker, meant for use with DnD 5E.
To use:
1. Unzip and extract the contents of the .zip file to a folder.
2. Run `initiativeTracker.exe`.
3. You will see some placeholder characters and monsters. You can add new characters by pressing the relevant buttons, ensuring to fill out the given fields.
4. To add a player, click on the checkbox next to their name in the "Player" list. They will be added to the queue. You can remove them from the queue by unchecking this checkbox.
5. To add a monster, click on its name in the "Player" list. It will be added to the queue. To remove a monster, click on its name in the queue instead.
6. Press the "Roll for Initiative!" button to calculate the initiative of all players and/or monsters in the queue. The tool will roll for you and show the total initiative score rolled after applying the character's dexterity modifier. 

A small passion project to help me keep track of initiative while I DM my game. Gonna keep adding to it as time goes on.
