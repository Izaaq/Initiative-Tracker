TODO:
- Make UI to allow for easily adding new characters/monsters, like a small window for a form. [DONE]
- Make UI for main application [DONE]
- Use a .json file to store player and monster data [DONE]
- Maybe monsters don't have checkbox, but when clicked on in "Queue" they are removed? Clicking just adds another monster [DONE]
- Have a library of pre-made monsters
- Be able to view each character's HP and AC, able to update HP
- Hovering over a character reveals more details; ie saving throws, other stats, CR...
- Add CR at the top, allows to calculate difficulty of the encounter
- Allow current players to be edited
